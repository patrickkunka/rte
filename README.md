# Tome
An extensible, dependency-free rich text editor.

In progress..

#### Todos

- additional IME mutation detection work
- trigger warn callback when deleting a custom block
- if changing block type or toggling inline markup over a custom block, ignore it
- if carat is within a custom block and an action is triggered, block it
- if custom block inserted at end of editor, render empty p tag afterwards so that we can get behind it
